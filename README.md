## FAQ

#### Why did I choose the color scheme that I did  ?

I chose to go with an orange and grey/black colour scheme and orange is a strong colour. In the case of UI, orange is a evokes high energy and enthusiasm which is great for a gym website. Grey was used as a background color as it contrasts nicely with the strong orange colour.

#### Why chose a one page layout
I chose a one page layout as it seemed the most user-friendly way of interacting with the website. The user can easily scrolling down through the website without the need to be jumping from page to page waiting for them to load.


## Feedback

On inital testing there was no form for an online consultation. When getting user feedback and when further researching other gym websites I noticed some gyms offering free online consultation. I felt this would be a great addition to the website
