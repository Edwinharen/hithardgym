        <h3>Liam Kirk</h3>
        <p>Ten years ago I was overweight, lethargic, and with very low self-esteem. Today, I am the fittest I have ever been. I’ve managed to lose 50 pounds and turn my life by 180 degrees. Now, I find joy in using my own experience and qualifications to help people just like you. I know exactly how you feel. I don’t have to try to put myself in your shoes… I have walked in your shoes and I can now help you turn your life around, too.</p>

    <h1>Spin Class</h1>
    <br>
    <p>An hour-long Spin class can burn anywhere from 600-1000 calories depending on the intensity of the instructor and the amount that you push yourself. It relies on a combination of fast-paced cycling and strategic lighter rest intervals to get you recovered for the next burst. Most spinning classes last around 40 minutes so you’ll be burning about 400-600 calories per class.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Pilates is a form of exercise that concentrates on strengthening the core muscles in the body. Using a series of moves and postures, the exercises work the abdominal muscles to help you improve your posture and build strength, and it also helps to increase flexibility. Pilates helps to give you a full-body workout.</p>
